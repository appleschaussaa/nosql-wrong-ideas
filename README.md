## Overview
​
### The challenge
​
Users should be able to:
​
- Be familiar with node, NoSQL/MongoDB and Insomnia
- Use dependencies/devDependencies such as express, mongoose and nodemon
​
### Links
​
- GitHub repo URL: [appleschaussaa/nosql-wrong-ideas](https://github.com/appleschaussaa/nosql-wrong-ideas)
​
## My process
​
### Built with
​
- Node.js
- NoSQL: MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Express
​
### What I learned
​
I learned about how much more flexibly and slightly easier to use NoSQL can be for certain thing especially when one is familiar with javascript and like how much more modernized MongoDB compass is compared to MySQL. It was also nice not having to deal with SQL files and just operate js files.
​
### Continued development
​
Unfortunaly some medical situation stole away a lot of time while trying to complete this so wasn't able to make it quite to the finish line by the time I was recovered. So this should be an easy project to come back to and fully complete. The biggest holdback was the fact that I thought I had already finished the seeds and data files and spent too much time troubleshooting why the routes showed up fine without any 404 or 500 error but could not be found. Feel kinda foolish it took me some hours to figure it out.
​
### Useful resources
​
- [Example resource 1](https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/mongoose/mongoose-validate-unique-email) - Used to remember the match property to include a email regex.
- [Example resource 2](https://courses.bootcampspot.com/courses/2570/assignments/43465?module_item_id=814934) - Used for the email regex.
- [Example resource 2](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/typescript/virtuals.html) - This helped setup the virtuals more streamlined in the models

## Acknowledgments

Despite not liking the tutoring experience I had earlier in the class and kind of turning away from any of the assistance tool because of it, having talked with a few classmate and their experience with AskBCS it has made me open to giving it a try and will take more advantage of that. The TAs always help but it seems like the crucial errors and mistake occur outside of after class time.
