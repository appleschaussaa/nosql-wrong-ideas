## Overview
​
### The challenge
​
Users should be able to:
​
- Be familiar with NoSQL/MongoDB and Insomnia
- Use dependencies/devDependencies such as express, mongoose and nodemon
​

### Walkthrough

​
## My process
​
### Built with
​
- Node.js
- NoSQL: MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Express
- API routes and controllers
​
### What I learned
​
I learned that as you progress you will still get stumpted by small errors, in this case it was using userId in my user controller instead of just id. Couldnt not figure why only the getUsers path was working. Glad a TA could help me out.
​
### Continued development
​
I was able to get nearly every route to work except for the reaction ones. Think I got confused on how the reactions should work...
Also maybe a new name because ​I have to keep explaining the name nosql-wrong-ideas, which is just a pun of "no wrong ideas", got docked points for that.
### Useful resources
​
- [Example resource 1](https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/mongoose/mongoose-validate-unique-email) - Used to remember the match property to include a email regex.
- [Example resource 2](https://courses.bootcampspot.com/courses/2570/assignments/43465?module_item_id=814934) - Used for the email regex.
- [Example resource 3](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/typescript/virtuals.html) - This helped setup the virtuals more streamlined in the models

## Acknowledgments

Despite not liking the tutoring experience I had earlier in the class and kind of turning away from any of the assistance tool because of it, having talked with a few classmate and their experience with AskBCS it has made me open to giving it a try and will take more advantage of that. The TAs always help but it seems like the crucial errors and mistake occur outside of after class time.

On top of this I would also like to thank our TA Scott for finding the error that got everything rolling!
